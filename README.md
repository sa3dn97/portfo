Features
My website serves as a showcase for all the projects I've worked on. On the homepage, you can find links to all of my projects along with detailed descriptions and images that demonstrate what each project does.

Control Actions
I have used Flask and Python in my back-end to control any actions. When you send me a message through the contact page, I receive it, and it will appear on a csv file I created.

Contact Me
You can go to the contact page and send me a message. It's my pleasure to hear from you and respond to your messages.
